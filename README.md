# CS-3010-Numerical-Methods
This repository stores a few of my projects from my class CS 3010 - Numerical Methods
I took this course at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

There are 4 Projects in this repository. 

- One project implements Gaussian Elimination. The user can read in a text file with a matrix or the user can manually input a matrix
- Another project uses both Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration methods to solve linear equations. Users can manually enter or read in a file.
- Another project gets the root of equations using the Bisection, Newton Raphson, Secant, and Modified Secant methods.
- The last project produces Newtons Divided Difference table, Interpolating, and Simplified forms of an equation.


## Things I learned in this course
- Linear algebra concepts
- Linear Transformations and Matrix Factorizations
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors,
- Floating-point representations
- Roots of non-linear equations
- Systems of linear equations
- Interpolation
- Numerical integration
